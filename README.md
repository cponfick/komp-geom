# Computational Geometry in Kotlin

This repository contains a collection of algorithms and data structures for computational geometry implemented in
Kotlin. The focus is on providing efficient and easy-to-use solutions for common geometric problems.

## Implemented Algorithms

| Algorithm    | Implementation     | Runtime Complexity | Space Complexity |
|--------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|
| Closest Pair | Naive              | O(n^2)             | O(1)             |
| Closest Pair | Divide and Conquer | O(n log n)         | O(n)             |
